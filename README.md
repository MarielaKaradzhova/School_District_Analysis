### Resources

Data Source: "schools_complete.csv", "students_complete.csv", located here: https://github.com/MarielaKaradzhova/School_District_Analysis/tree/main/Resources

Software: Python 3.7.6,Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4


### Overview of School District Analysis

THe purpose of this analysis was to clean the student data from the sources mentioned above, specifically for students in Grade 9 at Thomas High School. Many students entered prefixes such as [Dr. ", "Mr. ","Ms. ", "Mrs. ", "Miss ", " MD", " DDS", " DVM", " PhD"] before their first and last name, which in turn tampered the data and returned innacurate results.

In addition, it was important to note the changes in results from the raw data (see "Data Source") after the data was cleaned and organized into several data frames.

In particular, there are 4 main categories affected by the analysis as listed below:

1. Math and Reading Scores by Grade 
2. Scores by School Spending
3. Scores by School Size
4. Scores by Type of School



### Results

How is the district summary affected?

The table below is a snippet of the original analysis performed on raw data before it was cleaned. There are subtle changes to the district summary, such as achievement between Charter Schools and Disctrict Schools, where Charter Schools show higher scores in Math and Reading.

How is the school summary affected?

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
